# gravity
A n-body simulation written in C++. Very WIP

# Goals
- Visualise simulation in VTK
- Different algorithms for better efficiency
- Export results in different formats

# Build instructions
Requires
- CMake to build
- VTK for visualisation
- Doxygen to generate documentation

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
